# Clustering
In this project, I used the  K-means algorithm and elbow technique to find the best value of ```K``` for a dataset created by ```make_blobs```. It also contains some complex clustering examples with illustrations and uses K-means to reduce an image's size.
Also, the DBSCAN algorithm and some parameter tuning for the epsilon and MinPts are implemented.
