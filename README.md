# Data Mining projects
## Projects
* [Iris Dataset analysis](https://github.com/MohammadJavadArdestani/Data-Mining-projects/tree/main/Iris%20Dataset%20analysis)<br>
-- This project contains five main parts, which are implemented by two major preprocessing libraries ```Pandas``` and ```Scikit-learn```
* [Classification by Neural Network](https://github.com/MohammadJavadArdestani/Data-Mining-projects/tree/main/Classification%20by%20Neural%20Network)<br>
-- This project is mainly based on working with ```Tensorflow``` to create several neural networks and evaluate their different elements.
* [Diabetes Detection by ‍‍‍XGBoost Classifier](https://github.com/MohammadJavadArdestani/Data-Mining-projects/tree/main/Diabetes_detection_by_XGBoost_Classifier)<br>
-- In this project, the ```XGBoost``` model is used to detect Diabetes for about 70K samples. It also contains some ```preprocessing``` and ``Hyperparameter tuning`` steps to enhance the detection performance.

* [Association Rules](https://github.com/MohammadJavadArdestani/Data-Mining-projects/tree/main/Association%20Rules)
The goal of this project is extracting ```Association Rules```  from ```Hypermarket_dataset``` using ```TransactionEncoder``` and```Apriori algorithm```.
