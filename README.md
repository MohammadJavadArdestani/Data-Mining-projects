## Projects
* [Iris Dataset analysis](https://github.com/MohammadJavadArdestani/Data-Mining-projects/tree/main/Iris%20Dataset%20analysis)<br>
-- This project contains five main parts, which are implemented by two major preprocessing libraries ```Pandas``` and ```Scikit-learn```
* [Classification by Neural Network](https://github.com/MohammadJavadArdestani/Data-Mining-projects/tree/main/Classification%20by%20Neural%20Network)<br>
-- This project is mainly based on working with ```Tensorflow``` to create several neural networks and evaluate their different elements.
